Hi James! I have a task for you. I need you to write a function that will take a string and return the number of vowels in the string.

So when the function is called like this:
count_vowels("hello")

The function will return:

2

Because the string "hello" has 2 vowels (e and o).
'''
def count_vowels(sentence):
    

        


#I used the internet for help and I still could not do this one 
#Hint: How many parameters does the question ask you to have in the function?
#Hint: What is the function supposed to return?
#Hint: Is your function returning anything?

Well done James, I like your solution and the way you have thought through this problem, but this solution is incorrect.

I want you to read the question again and understand what it is asking you to do.

You need to write a function that will take a string and return the number of vowels in the string.

Hint: How many parameters does the question ask you to have in the function?
Hint: What is the function supposed to return?
Hint: Is your function returning anything?
