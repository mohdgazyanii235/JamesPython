Hi James! I have a task for you. I need you to write a function that will take a number n and return the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

So when the function is called like this:
fibonacci(5)

The function will return:

5

Because the 5th number in the Fibonacci sequence is 5 as seen below.
1, 1, 2, 3, 5...
